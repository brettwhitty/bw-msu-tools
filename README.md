# bw-msu-tools
Archive of personal scripts repository from my various projects in the Buell Lab at MSU (Jan. 2008 - Apr. 2011)

Most of the scripts here were (ill-?)conceived and authored by me --- with a few exceptions (eg: a couple BioPerl utility scripts)
that I'd modified to fix bugs (eg: to correct GFF3 encoding, etc.) --- while working on the following projects:

- Solanaceae Comparative Genomics Resource
- Potato Genome Sequencing Consortium (PGSC)
- Solanaceae Coordinated Agricultural Project (SolCAP)
- Pythium ultimum genome project
... and maybe others I'm forgetting.

P.S.: At the time these scripts were written, dumping your *personal utility scripts* into a public repo was still sort of a thing that only
folks into peacocking would do (and maybe it's just that more bioinformatics folks are into peacocking now); in any case, that's why these
are only being deposited as an archival mirror here now. Yes it's Perl code, and yes there's a lot of it.
