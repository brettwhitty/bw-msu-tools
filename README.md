Archive of personal scripts repository from my various projects in the Buell Lab at MSU (Jan. 2008 - Apr. 2011)

Most of the scripts here were (ill-?)conceived and authored by me --- with a few exceptions (eg: a couple BioPerl utility scripts)
that I'd modified to fix bugs (eg: to correct GFF3 encoding, etc.) --- while working on the following projects:

- Solanaceae Comparative Genomics Resource
- Potato Genome Sequencing Consortium (PGSC)
- Solanaceae Coordinated Agricultural Project (SolCAP)
- Pythium ultimum genome project
... and maybe others I'm forgetting.
